            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Welcome to HR2 Employee Management System, a key component of the Bus Transportation Management System. Our role is to ensure newly hired employees from HR1 are effectively onboarded, assigned to the right roles, and equipped with the necessary skills to excel.</p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">To support professional development, we provide structured training programs through online modules. Employees must first request access to a module through the Request Module section and wait for admin approval before proceeding to answer the training assessments via Google Forms. This process ensures a guided learning experience tailored to individual needs.</p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">At HR2, we are committed to enhancing workforce readiness, streamlining training, and fostering a well-prepared team that contributes to the safe and efficient operation of our transportation services.</p>
